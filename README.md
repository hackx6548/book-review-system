**So, What's REST API?**

Before answering this, we have to answer what's an API?

> API stands for Application Programming Interface and software programs use APIs to communicate with each other.

Usually, clients such as mobile apps or web front-end use APIs to communicate with application server.

> REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and it's an architectural style that use HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data.

To create our app that will be an API server:

```bash
$ rails new book_review_system --api
```

--api will remove the assets, helpers and views that makes an application work on browser.
